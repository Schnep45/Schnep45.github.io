Building this site was my first dive into web development. I knew I didn't want to build everything from scratch, but I
also wanted to learn about whats in the "guts" of a website so I didn't want to use a gui based website builder. 
After doing some research I decided to build a site using [Jekyll] as a site generator and hosting it on [GitHub Pages].
I have used Git as a code repository so when I found out that [GitHub Pages] provided website hosting for free it was an easy choice.
Picking a static site generator took some more research. There are a lot of [static site generators] out there, but [Jekyll] looked like it would be a great option.
[Jekyll] is a simple static site generator written in Ruby that was developed by one of the co-founders of GitHub. 
A static site works great for what I need. The abundant [themes] available from the [Jekyll] community give a good starting off point, 
it is easy to add posts to the site via markdown files, and its compatible with [GitHub Pages].

Once I decided what I was going to use to build and host the site I found a theme I liked ([jekyll uno]) and started to customize
it by by changing the html and css in the repository. Some of the things I changed include the fonts, images, data, gradients, font sizes for different page size,
and adding a picture preview to the catalogue for the posts.

This has been a great opportunity for me to learn about the topics below, and I am very happy with how the site turned out.

- HTML, CSS, Markdown
- SSL certificates
- DNS Providers
- Website Architecture
- Git Hub Pages
- Jekyll 
- Website Responsiveness
